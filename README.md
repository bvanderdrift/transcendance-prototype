# Transcendance

From my original post on the Oculus fora: ([source](https://forums.oculusvr.com/community/discussion/6000/transcendance-a-musical-experience))

> So I am extremely hyped about the Rift and have been following it for over a year now. I am a computer science student, with not that much money, so haven't been able to buy the DK (yet). I created this little demo of about 6/7 minutes long, and now need people to test my experience, and tell me how well it works out for the Rift (and for any extra idea's if you have any). I have no clue about scale etc, so tell me what you think!

> I love music and programming, so I decided to create a VR experience where you can just sit and watch the evironment react to the music. I chose a song which I liked and tried to make something good looking. The graphics are not that good, I'm a programmer no artist, haha!

> The song is: Stereopole - Get Connected. I have contacted the artist and he gave me permission. His soundcloud:
